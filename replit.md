## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a single-page application (SPA) architecture built entirely with vanilla web technologies. The frontend is structured around a chatbot interface that uses a class-based JavaScript approach for state management and user interaction handling.

**Core Components:**
- **ChitraFluxChatbot Class**: Central controller managing conversation flow, user selections, and response generation
- **State Management**: Simple object-based state tracking for user selections (category, style, complexity, platform)
- **DOM Manipulation**: Direct JavaScript DOM manipulation for dynamic content updates and user interface interactions

**UI/UX Design Pattern:**
- **Option-Based Interface**: Reduces user input complexity by providing clickable options instead of free-form text
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Guides users through a step-by-step selection process
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for cross-device compatibility

### Data Architecture
The application uses a static data structure approach with predefined categorizations and options stored in JavaScript objects.

**Data Organization:**
- **Categories Object**: Contains structured data for art types, styles, complexity levels, and platform optimizations
- **Color Palettes Object**: Predefined color schemes with hex codes for different design contexts
- **Template System**: Structured prompt generation using category-specific templates

**Content Generation Strategy:**
- **Rule-Based Prompts**: Algorithmic generation of AI art prompts based on user selections
- **Platform Optimization**: Tailored prompt formatting for different AI art platforms
- **Multi-Option Delivery**: Provides 2-3 prompt variations per user request

### User Interface Architecture
The interface implements a conversational chatbot design pattern with visual enhancement elements.

**Layout Structure:**
- **Header Section**: Branding and application identity
- **Hero Section**: Feature showcase and value proposition
- **Chatbot Interface**: Main interaction area with message history and quick actions
- **Typing Indicators**: Real-time feedback for enhanced user experience

**Styling Architecture:**
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Consistent theming and maintainable styles
- **Animation System**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Modern CSS Features**: Gradients, shadows, and advanced layout techniques
